# Energy_index

This repository contains code and data that can be used to reproduce the results in the following paper: 

> Allen, S. and Otero, N (2022). 
> Standardised indices to monitor energy droughts
> EarthArxiv pre-print: [https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4752/](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/4752/).

This includes methods to construct standardised energy indices, define energy droughts, and analyse the characteristics of the resulting droughts.

These methods are applied to reconstructed time series of electricity demand and wind and solar energy production.

# Energy_index

This repository contains code and data that can be used to reproduce the results in the following paper: Allen and Otero (2022), "Standardised indices for the monitoring of energy droughts". 

The code includes methods to construct standardised energy indices, to define energy droughts, and to analyse the characteristics of the resulting droughts.

These methods are applied to reconstructed time series of electricity demand and wind and solar energy production.
